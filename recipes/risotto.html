    <h2>Description</h2>
    Making risotto at home may seem like a daunting task, but our recipe breaks the process down into simple steps for a foolproof result. Aromatics like shallots, garlic, and thyme build layers of flavor, while gradually adding hot stock as you stir helps coax the starches out of the arborio rice for the creamiest risotto. We love incorporating mushrooms for added flavor, but feel free to make the dish without—or swap in your favorite vegetable! Savory and rich, risotto will make the perfect centerpiece dish for your next dinner party.        <br><br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine(120 mL), or lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh parsley(10 g), for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the heat and keep nearby.</li>
            <br><li>Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.</li>
            <br><li>Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have cooked down and browned.</li>
            <br><li>Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <br><li>Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until aromatic.</li>
            <br><li>Add the white wine and cook until evaporated, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <br><li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until the stock is fully absorbed by the rice.</li>
            <br><li>Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until fully absorbed, 15-20 minutes. Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.</li>
            <br><li>Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.</li>
            <br><li>Garnish the risotto with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <br><li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
